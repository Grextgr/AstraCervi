                <h3>Why did we choose this challenge?</h3>
                <p>We chose this challenge because in Mexico, over 30% of children lack access to interactive or digital reading materials, missing the chance to explore, imagine, and learn about their world.</p>

                <h3>Our problem</h3>
                <p>As digital education grows, this gap continues to expand—leaving more children without access to educational content that inspires curiosity and understanding.</p>

                        <p>
                            Although the Sun is 93 million miles away from our planet, solar activity can significantly impact our daily lives. “Space weather”—the variations that occur in the space environment between the Sun and Earth—can impact technologies in space and on Earth. Your challenge is to write and illustrate a digital children’s story that explains what space weather is and the varying impacts it has on different people such as farmers, pilots, astronauts, power grid operators, and the general public. You can tell the story from the perspective of a person impacted by space weather or from the point of view of a solar flare or coronal mass ejection (CME) as it approaches Earth.

                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    AstraStories is a digital platform that brings illustrated and interactive stories to children, making science and reading accessible to everyone. In Mexico, millions of children grow up without access to digital reading materials, limiting their imagination and curiosity. AstraStories turns this challenge into an opportunity by offering fun and educational stories that explain complex scientific topics like space weather. Through its freemium, premium, and school models, the project promotes reading comprehension, scientific curiosity, and critical thinking, turning each story into a bridge between imagination and knowledge, helping children dream without limits and discover the wonders of the universe they live in.
